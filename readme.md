This Project does image classification using machine learning (SVM Algorithm) to predict probability of image having apple, banana, mango, orange.

The above repository has notebook and model saved using pickle library. (you may directly use saved model instead of building one by uploading it in your runtime to the data.)
link for img_model: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iLV9jsJebkTs_ELGRetjmZNB8AnEqvkC/view?usp=sharing

the project has been deployed as webapp with streamlit and ngrok to give gui enhacing user experience pls feel free to use it.

Steps to use the Image Classification System


To use webapp run second last cell.
If a warning is seen click on reset runtime.

Upload the img_model.p and app.py in data in your runtime.

Run last cell.
Then click on link of the format http://XXXXXXXXXXXX.ngrok.io.

Uload the image to test.

Click on predict and see your results.
