This Project does image classification using machine learning (SVM Algorithm) to predict probability of image having apple, banana, mango, orange.

The above repository has notebook and model saved using pickle. (you may directly use saved model instead of building one by uploading it in your runtime to the data.)

the project has been deployed as webapp with streamlit and ngrok to give gui enhacing user experience pls feel free to use it.
to use webapp upload the img_model.p in data in your runtime  and run cells with first line comment as --> deployment of the model as web app.
                                                                                                       --> writing python file for webapp.
                                                                                                       --> deploying ngrok server.
then click on link of the format http://XXXXXXXXXXXX.ngrok.io.
upload the image to test.
click on predict and see your results.
