The above repository has notebook and model saved using pickle library. (you may directly use saved model instead of building one by uploading it in your runtime to the data.)
link for img_model: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iLV9jsJebkTs_ELGRetjmZNB8AnEqvkC/view?usp=sharing

the project has been deployed as webapp with streamlit and ngrok to give gui enhacing user experience pls feel free to use it.
to use webapp run cells with first line comment as deployment of the model as web app.
if a warning is seen click on reset runtime.
upload the img_model.p and app.py in data in your runtime
run cells with first line comment as deploying ngrok server.
then click on link of the format http://XXXXXXXXXXXX.ngrok.io.
upload the image to test.
click on predict and see your results.
